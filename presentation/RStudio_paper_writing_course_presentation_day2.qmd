## Paper writing in Quarto/Rmarkdown

-   Powerful and versatile text editing with simple Markdown syntax or visual editor (similar to Word)

-   Easy insertion and formatting of references from the web or a .bib file

-   Supports equations, tables, code blocks

-   Directly insert your figures generated by your scripts in the same project

-   Can 'knit' into html, pdf or docx formats

-   -\> Open manuscript/Manuscript.qmd\]

## Quarto - Documentation

<br>

-   Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation.
-   To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## The YAML header

- A YAML header contains YAML arguments, such as “title”, “author”, and “output”, demarcated by three dashes (-) on either end.
- When you create a new Quarto doc or presentation, it is created with a short YAML

```{r}
#| echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE
---
title: "Untitled"
format: html
---
  
```

- There is a more complex YAML in manuscript/Manuscript.qmd

```{r}
#| echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE

## Inserting references

<br>

-   In Visual mode, go to 'Insert' -\> 'Citation'
-   search for reference on pubmed etc.
-   'Insert' will add the ref to the bibliograpy.bib file
-   in 'Source' mode, you can directly insert the reference with [@ref_id] (preferred, faster method)
-   add new refs to your .bib file with the command-line command:

:\$ curl -LH "Accept: application/x-bibtex" https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34550 \>\> ./references.bib <br>

::: callout-warning
-   need to add references.bib to the YAML header as bibliography: references.bib
-   also define bibliography style in the YAML with csl: elife.csl #add .csl according to journal
:::



## Tables

```{r}
#| echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE

#render built-in iris table with tinytable
tinytable::tt(head(iris))

#create some data
mydata <- tibble(
  gene = c("A", "B"),
  expression = c(1.1, 0.4)
  )

#render table
tt(mydata)

#read data
resources_table <- readxl::read_xls("../analysis/data/Key_resource_table.xls")

tt(
  resources_table, caption = "Key Resources Table", 
  theme = "grid", width = 1
  )

```


## Collaborative code and paper writing with Rstudio and GitHub

<br>

-   GitHub www.github.com is a platform for software development and version control
-   owned by Microsoft since 2018
-   developers can have public and private repositories
-   can share repositories privately with collaborators
-   integrates well with Rstudio
-   uses git protocol that is open source and also used by other code-hosting sites
-   we should have a COS/UniHD git site...

## The workflow

-   Create a new project or clone a template project on GitHub
-   In Rstudio, New Project -\> Version control -\> add GitHub repo URL and save locally
-   Change the code
-   You can 'commit' and then 'push' changes to GitHub
-   Your collaborators can be added on GitHub
-   Collaborators can 'pull' to their own computer and 'push' their own changes
-   If two developers push changes to the same repo, this can lead to conflict
-   This can be managed by starting new 'branches'
-   Branches can be 'merged' to the original 'master' branch
-   A collaborator can issue a 'pull request' to merge their branch to the master

## Collaborations - sharing and commenting

<br>

-   Adding comments directly to the Quarto file with "<!--# my comment -->" (these will not be knitted to the output)
- share as .docx and ask collaborators to use track changes (then why did we take this course...)
- collaborate on the same GitHub repository, use branches and pull requests (only makes sense if the collaborators are very involved)
- in principle you could use an Rproject for data, code and figures, and write text+refs on Gdocs+Paperpile or Overleaf+bib
- share commentable html through your github or other website
- we will use 'https://hypothes.is/' to add commenting functionality to an html 
- you need an account (easy and free)
- we use a https://github.com/hypothesis/client script that is sourced at the end of the quarto file by \<script src="hypothes.is/embed.js" async></script> to make this work

::: callout-warning
- if you re-render the html and overwrite the shared file, the comments will be gone
